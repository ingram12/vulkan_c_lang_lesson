# Vulkan Triangle Tutorial (C)

This repository contains the source code written during a **Russian-language video tutorial series** on building a Vulkan-based application in the C programming language.

The goal of this project is to create a **minimal application** that renders a single triangle using the Vulkan API.  
It serves as a learning resource, walking step-by-step through Vulkan initialization and the rendering pipeline.
